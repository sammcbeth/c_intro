!bitwise operators!
- used for comparing the binary representation of a number
- whatever operation goes bit by bit within that binary representation
- so or returns 1 if either number has a 1 in that binary rep spot
    - 1101 1100
    - 0011 0011
    = 1111 1111
- and requires both to have 1 in that spot
    - 1101 1100
    - 0011 0011
    = 0001 0000
- shift : << or >>
    - 0011 1100
    - <<
    - 1111 0000
