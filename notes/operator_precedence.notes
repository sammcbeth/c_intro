!operator precedence!
- the order of executing the various operations can make a difference so C needs unabiguous rules for choosing what to do first
- each operator is assigned  aprecedence level
- multiolication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction so they are performed first
- whatever is enclosed in paranthesis is executed first should just always use () to group expressions
- two ops have same precedence
    - then associativity rules are applied
